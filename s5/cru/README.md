# CRU Pendulum Compatibility Code.

The code in this directory is designed to inter-operate with the code originally 
released by Schirmer et al [2022] [here](https://github.com/boschresearch/Continuous-Recurrent-Units), 
and more specifically, the modified version of this code released
[here](https://github.com/andrewwarrington/Continuous-Recurrent-Units). 

The code in this directory heavily builds off the code in the original repository
giving the classes and functions for the _Pendulum regression_ example.  

We do not package the generation of the raw data here.  To generate the data,
please execute the instructions contained in the forked repo
[here](https://github.com/andrewwarrington/Continuous-Recurrent-Units).

This will generate the data which will then be read in by this code, and converted
into the format required by the S5 code.

Please reach out if you have any questions! 

Thanks,

-- The S5 Authors.
